# Customer Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw customer data using **Python (pandas)** in Google Colab.  

The dataset includes customer details such as names, phone numbers, addresses, and payment status.  
The goal was to remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare a clean dataset ready for analysis.

Key tasks performed in the notebook:
- ✅ Removed duplicate rows and duplicate `CustomerID`s  
- ✅ Renamed columns to follow consistent `snake_case` naming  
- ✅ Standardized phone numbers (kept only valid 10-digit numbers, reformatted them)  
- ✅ Combined first and last names into `full_name`  
- ✅ Handled missing values in `state` and `zip_code` columns  
- ✅ Cleaned and unified address fields  
- ✅ Exported the final cleaned dataset to a CSV file
