Customer call list Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw customer data using **Python (pandas)** in Google Colab.  

The dataset includes customer details such as names, phone numbers, addresses, and payment status.  
The goal was to remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare a clean dataset ready for analysis.

Key tasks performed in the notebook:

✅ Removed duplicate rows and duplicate `CustomerID`s.

✅ Standardized phone numbers (kept only valid 10-digit numbers, reformatted them).

✅ Combined first and last names into `full_name`. 

✅ Handled missing values in `state` and `zip_code` columns.  

✅ Handled NaN entries.

✅ Cleaned and unified address fields.

✅ Exported the final cleaned dataset to a Excel file.
